            <h1>My Experience</h1>
            <p>
                I have learned my Full Stack Web Development course from Vidyastu. The course started on 11th November, 2023. It was a 6-month course (4 months course + 2 months Internship). I got the opportunity to do my internship at Sisyphus Infotech on 14th May, 2024, which ended on 14th July, 2024. It was a team project of 4 people, and in this project, I learned how to collaborate with team members and communicate effectively with others. I gained hands-on experience mainly in Frontend Development, working extensively with React.js, including libraries like react-icons, react-router-dom, and react-countdown. I built an entire 'About page' for our Photography website project. I received my certificate for completing both my course and internship. Later, at CognoRise Infotech, I got the opportunity to work on more projects and received my offer letter.

                In addition to these experiences, I completed a freelancing project for Avoron with two team members, where we delivered a comprehensive digital solution that included the AbsDreamsFacility service. I also managed the social media accounts for Avoron, developing and executing strategies that boosted user engagement and brand presence. Furthermore, I worked with Optimum Finserv Private Limited for 3 months, where I was responsible for their social media management. I built their Facebook page from scratch, gained organic followers, and created targeted ads for recruitment purposes. I will attach my certificates and offer letters on this page.
